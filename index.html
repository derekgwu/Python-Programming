                <h2>Chapter 0: Python Overview and Installation</h2>

                <h4>Section 0.1: Introduction</h4>

                <p>Welcome to Python Programming! This comprehensive guide offers a full introduction
                    to software development in Python. For reference, this is an HTML document (with CSS and JS)
                    that is structured from a programmer's perspective. The first couple chapters are pivotal for
                    anyone programming in Python, but the latter chapters continue on with the theory side of computer
                    science.
                </p>
                <p>If this is your first time programming, Python is a fantastic choice. It is very easy to read
                    compared to Java and C++. It is widely used as well, specifically by big tech comapnies such as
                    Instagram and Facebook.
                </p>

                <h4>Section 0.2: Installing Python</h4>
                <p>If you do not have Python already installed, please read this section. Otherwise, you can move onto
                    the next section, <a href="#section1.3" class="section_link">Running Your First Program</a>.
                </p>

                <p>To install Python, you'll need two things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python (duh)</li>
                    <li>An Integrated development environment (IDE)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Installing Python is quite simple, go to this <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="section_link">link</a>
                and follow the setup wizard to install Python.</p>

                <p>To setup an IDE, you first must choose an IDE. An IDE is like an online notebook where you write code 
                    and run code. There are many options to choose from, but I personally suggest VSCode. You can download
                    and setup VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" class="section_link">here.</a>
                </p>
                <h4 id="section1.3">Section 0.3: Running Your First Program</h4>
                <p>To check if Python is successfully installed, open up your command terminal and type "python". If 
                    a version number appears in your command line, Python is succesfully installed and you are ready
                    to run your first program.
                </p>

                <p>The first program we will run is the "Hello World" program, which displays Hello World
                    on your terminal. Luckily in Python, this program is very short and is only one line.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="string">"Hello World"</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Pretty simple? Run the program on your IDE and you should see:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">Hello World</span>             
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>And that's it! You have run your first program! Give yourself a pat on the back. You
                    may have notice that anything we put inside the parenthesis gets print to the terminal.
                    These are known as <a class="italics">print statements</a>. Try writing your own print
                    statements. 
                </p>
                <pre class="practice_pre">
                <h3 class="practice_header">PRACTICE:</h3><p>Try to print your name to the terminal.</p>
                </pre>
                

                <p>Use practice sections within the chapters to enhance your understanding of the concepts. They are built
                    so you get practice writing the syntax and understanding what each statement does.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h2>Chapter 1: Becoming a Programmer</h2>
                <h4>Section 1.1: Introduction to Programming</h4>
                <p>Every time we interact with a computer, we are interacting with someone's code 
                    (usually). It might not seem like it, but we take many things for granted. 
                    From banking to YouTube, everything has been automated to be as efficient as 
                    possible. All of our everyday convenience in technology has likely been the 
                    result of countless software designs today.</p>
                    <pre class="practice_pre">
                        <h3 class="practice_header">THINK:</h3><p>What's a piece of technology that you use every day that likely has code in it?</p>
                    </pre>
                <h4>Section 1.1.1 What Goes In Must Come Out</h4>
                <p>When programming, you often want to narrow your programs into a simple input-output process.
                    That is your program should take in a problem and output a solution. The <a class="italics">
                        black box
                    </a>, that is what happens in between input and output is up to you to program, but the final product
                    should not worry about it.
                </p>
                <img src="images/thumbnail_Black-box.jpg">
                <h4>Section 1.2 Design Time, Compile Time, Execute Time</h4>
                <p>As a programmer, we are usually tasked with a problem and have to develop a solution to it. At a high-level, 
                    we can break down our problems in software development into three stages:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Design Time</li>
                    <li>Compile Time</li>
                    <li>Execution Time</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Section 1.2.1 Design Time</h4>
                <p>For example, let's say we work for NASA and we want to (hypothetically) travel to 
                    Mars. We've identified our problem, and the answer might seem obvious 
                    (rocket ship). But design time is not just coming up with a solution. 
                    It's coming up with implementations (aka HOW are we building the rocket ship). 
                    Design time is breaking down our big problems into smaller (and more manageable) 
                    problems. This could be answering the mini-questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How big of a rocket do we need?</li>
                    <li>How much oxygen do we need?</li>
                    <li>How much food do we need?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When it comes to software development, you'll want to spend 70-90% of the time designing. 
                    While it might seem like overkill, the more time you spend planning, 
                    the less time you'll have to spend coding and fixing your code. Because every 
                    time your code breaks, you'll be back at design time.</p>
                <h4>Section 1.2.2 Compile Time</h4>
                <p>This is basically the "coding time". But what does compiling mean? To understand compiling, 
                    let's pretend instead of talking to a computer, 
                    you are talking to the newest foreign exchange student. 
                    His English is not great, so it's difficult to get through to him. 
                    But your best friend speaks his language, so he's able to communicate 
                    with you and translate your English. That's what your programming language does. 
                    It's a way for the computer to understand our human ideas. When you compile your code, 
                    it's essentially translating it into binary, or a language your computer is fluent in.</p>
                <p>Compile time should be easy if you did a good job in design time. Otherwise, you'll be doing 
                    design time and compile time at the same time, and you'll work extra slowly. 
                    This should only be about 25% of the time spent in the development process.</p>

                    <h4>Section 1.2.3 Execution Time</h4>
                    <p>Finally, after you have designed your implementations and code, you are ready to run your code. 
                        Now, two things can happen here:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your code works as expected and you are finished</li>
                        <li>Your code breaks unexpectedly (more common occurrence)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If your code breaks, there are usually two types of errors you can run into</p>
                    <li>Syntax errors</li>
                    <p>This usually means you misspelled a variable name or made a typo somewhere. These are usually easy to fix as Python IDEs 
                        will tell you where the error is. Syntax is a fancy word for how we spell things.</p>
                    <li>Implementation errors</li>
                    <p>These are more common and harder to fix. This usually means your code does 
                        not do what it's supposed to do. This might be where you write a program to detect whether
                    a number is odd or even, and your program outputs odd for even numbers.</p>

                    <h4>Section 1.3 Unit Testing and Debugging</h4>
                    <p>Now how do you know when you are done? Your code needs to go through rigorous testing to
                        ensure it does what you expect it to do. This comes in the form of unit testing or test cases.
                        Unit tests are portions of code to systematically measure the outputs of your code. We will 
                        explore unit tests in further detail when we begin writing more complex programs.</p>

                        <p>But let's explore the concept of debugging. Likely, you won't write perfect code the first time 
                        and you'l have to revisit steps 1-3 in design, compile, and execute time. Debugging is the concept 
                        of seeing what you outputed and rethinking adn rewriting code in order to get the program to work
                        correctly.

                <h2>Chapter 2: Numbers and Variables</h2>
                <h4>Section 2.1: Introduction to Numbers in Programming</h4>
                <p>Computers and numbers are like peanut butter and jelly. They go together, but why?
                    What makes computers superior to humans is the ability to calculate and manage numbers
                    easily. Imagine processing <a class="italics">1024 * 546</a> in your head. By the time,
                    you probably even register the thought in oyur head, a Python program could have easily
                    displayed the answer.
                </p>

                <p>Let's revisit our trusted <a class="italics">print statements</a> and try printing some numbers.
                You can try simply:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="integer">1</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Which should show on your terminal</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">1</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            
                <h4>Section 2.2 Simple Math with Python</h4>
                <p>Python offers many simple math operations to perform. It offers the standard
                    four operators in math:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition: +</li>
                    <li>Subtraction: -</li>
                    <li>Multiplication: *</li>
                    <li>Division: /</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Python also offers the modulo operator (%) , which is similiar to calcualting the remainder
                    of two numbers. For example 7 % 3 = 1. 
                </p>
                <p>Simply, if we want to print any simple math between two numbers, we can simply do:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="integer">2</span><span>+</span><span class="integer">2</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Which outputs...</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">4</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Going back to the large multiplication example earlier, you can input the same 
                    numbers...</p>
                <pre>
                <code>
<span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="integer">1024 * 546</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                </code>
                </pre>
                <p>But with resounding speed, you'll get</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="comment">//I imported a library that calculates the speed of a program</span>
<span class="terminal">559104
Elapsed Time: 0.0 seconds</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Now you see why programming with numbers is amazing. You can perform specific tasks
                    with incredible speed. 
                </p>
                <pre class="practice_pre">
                    <h3 class="practice_header">PRACTICE</h3><p>Write a program that calculates the sum of 13, 67, 234</p>
                </pre>
                <p>Intially, Python supports PEMDAS and order of operations automatically. You can use parenthesis to prioritize
                    operations first. 
                </p>

                <h4>Section 2.3 Advanced Math and Variables</h4>
                <p>Another mathematical concept that is in programming is variables, commonly taught in a high school algebra
                    course. However, variables in algebra are different than variables in programming. In programming, variables
                    act a container that can hold a value. It's best if we see an example.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="variable">x</span> = <span class="integer">6</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In the code snippet above, you have created a container with the label "x" that is 
                    holding the value of 6. 
                </p>
                <p>If you want to print out whatever is inside the container using print statements, you
                    can simply write:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="variable">x</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Note, in this case you omit the quotation marks. If you are printing with quotation
                    marks, you'll print whatever is in between the quotation marks, which is known as a<a class="italics">
                    string.</a> Printing just x, will output:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">6</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
