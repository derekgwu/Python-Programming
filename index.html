                <h2>Chapter 0: Python Overview and Installation</h2>

                <h4 id="section0-1">Section 0.1: Introduction</h4>

                <p>Welcome to Python Programming! This comprehensive guide offers a full introduction
                    to software development in Python. For reference, this is an HTML document (with CSS and JS)
                    that is structured from a programmer's perspective. The first couple chapters are pivotal for
                    anyone programming in Python, but the latter chapters continue on with the theory side of computer
                    science.
                </p>
                <p>If this is your first time programming, Python is a fantastic choice. It is very easy to read
                    compared to Java and C++. It is widely used as well, specifically by big tech comapnies such as
                    Instagram and Facebook.
                </p>

                <h4 id="section0-2">Section 0.2: Installing Python</h4>
                <p>If you do not have Python already installed, please read this section. Otherwise, you can move onto
                    the next section, <a href="#section0-3" class="section_link">Running Your First Program</a>.
                </p>

                <p>To install Python, you'll need two things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python (duh)</li>
                    <li>An Integrated development environment (IDE)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Installing Python is quite simple, go to this <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="section_link">link</a>
                and follow the setup wizard to install Python.</p>

                <p>To setup an IDE, you first must choose an IDE. An IDE is like an online notebook where you write code 
                    and run code. There are many options to choose from, but I personally suggest VSCode. You can download
                    and setup VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" class="section_link">here.</a>
                </p>
                <h4 id="section0-3">Section 0.3: Running Your First Program</h4>
                <p>To check if Python is successfully installed, open up your command terminal and type "python". If 
                    a version number appears in your command line, Python is succesfully installed and you are ready
                    to run your first program.
                </p>

                <p>The first program we will run is the "Hello World" program, which displays Hello World
                    on your terminal. Luckily in Python, this program is very short and is only one line.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="string">"Hello World"</span><span class="keyword">)</span>

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Pretty simple? Run the program on your IDE and you should see:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">Hello World</span>             
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>And that's it! You have run your first program! Give yourself a pat on the back. You
                    may have notice that anything we put inside the parenthesis gets print to the terminal.
                    These are known as <a class="italics">print statements</a>. Try writing your own print
                    statements. 
                </p>
                <div class="flip-card" id="card1">
                    <div class="flip-card-inner">
                      <div class="flip-card-front">
                        <h3>Practice</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Write a program that prints "Python" to the terminal</p>
                        <p><a class="italics">Click on the box to reveal the answer</a></p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="flip-card-back">
                        <pre>
                            <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(<span class="string">"Python"</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                

                <p>Use practice sections within the chapters to enhance your understanding of the concepts. They are built
                    so you get practice writing the syntax and understanding what each statement does. All practice
                    boxes have answers attached when you click the box.

                <h4 id="section1-1">Section 1.1: Introduction to Programming</h4>
                <p>Every time we interact with a computer, we are interacting with someone's code 
                    (usually). It might not seem like it, but we take many things for granted. 
                    From banking to YouTube, everything has been automated to be as efficient as 
                    possible. All of our everyday convenience in technology has likely been the 
                    result of countless software designs today.</p>
                    <pre class="practice_pre">
                        <h3 class="practice_header">THINK:</h3><p>What's a piece of technology that you use every day that likely has code in it?</p>
                    </pre>
                <h4 id="section1-1-1">Section 1.1.1 What Goes In Must Come Out</h4>
                <p>When programming, you often want to narrow your programs into a simple input-output process.
                    That is your program should take in a problem and output a solution. The <a class="italics">
                        black box
                    </a>, that is what happens in between input and output is up to you to program, but the final product
                    should not worry about it.
                </p>
                <img src="images/thumbnail_Black-box.jpg">
                <h4 id="section1-2">Section 1.2 Design Time, Compile Time, Execute Time</h4>
                <p>As a programmer, we are usually tasked with a problem and have to develop a solution to it. At a high-level, 
                    we can break down our problems in software development into three stages:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Design Time</li>
                    <li>Compile Time</li>
                    <li>Execution Time</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 id="section1-2-1">Section 1.2.1 Design Time</h4>
                <p>For example, let's say we work for NASA and we want to (hypothetically) travel to 
                    Mars. We've identified our problem, and the answer might seem obvious 
                    (rocket ship). But design time is not just coming up with a solution. 
                    It's coming up with implementations (aka HOW are we building the rocket ship). 
                    Design time is breaking down our big problems into smaller (and more manageable) 
                    problems. This could be answering the mini-questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How big of a rocket do we need?</li>
                    <li>How much oxygen do we need?</li>
                    <li>How much food do we need?</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/rocket gif.gif">
                <p>When it comes to software development, you'll want to spend 70-90% of the time designing. 
                    While it might seem like overkill, the more time you spend planning, 
                    the less time you'll have to spend coding and fixing your code. Because every 
                    time your code breaks, you'll be back at design time.</p>
                <h4 id="section1-2-2">Section 1.2.2 Compile Time</h4>
                <p>This is basically the "coding time". But what does compiling mean? To understand compiling, 
                    let's pretend instead of talking to a computer, 
                    you are talking to the newest foreign exchange student. 
                    His English is not great, so it's difficult to get through to him. 
                    But your best friend speaks his language, so he's able to communicate 
                    with you and translate your English. That's what your programming language does. 
                    It's a way for the computer to understand our human ideas. When you compile your code, 
                    it's essentially translating it into binary, or a language your computer is fluent in.</p>
                <p>Compile time should be easy if you did a good job in design time. Otherwise, you'll be doing 
                    design time and compile time at the same time, and you'll work extra slowly. 
                    This should only be about 25% of the time spent in the development process.</p>

                    <h4 id="section1-2-3">Section 1.2.3 Execution Time</h4>
                    <p>Finally, after you have designed your implementations and code, you are ready to run your code. 
                        Now, two things can happen here:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your code works as expected and you are finished</li>
                        <li>Your code breaks unexpectedly (more common occurrence)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If your code breaks, there are usually two types of errors you can run into</p>
                    <li>Syntax errors</li>
                    <p>This usually means you misspelled a variable name or made a typo somewhere. These are usually easy to fix as Python IDEs 
                        will tell you where the error is. Syntax is a fancy word for how we spell things.</p>
                    <li>Implementation errors</li>
                    <p>These are more common and harder to fix. This usually means your code does 
                        not do what it's supposed to do. This might be where you write a program to detect whether
                    a number is odd or even, and your program outputs odd for even numbers.</p>

                    <h4 id="section1-3">Section 1.3 Unit Testing and Debugging</h4>
                    <p>Now how do you know when you are done? Your code needs to go through rigorous testing to
                        ensure it does what you expect it to do. This comes in the form of unit testing or test cases.
                        Unit tests are portions of code to systematically measure the outputs of your code. We will 
                        explore unit tests in further detail when we begin writing more complex programs.</p>

                        <p>But let's explore the concept of debugging. Likely, you won't write perfect code the first time 
                        and you'l have to revisit steps 1-3 in design, compile, and execute time. Debugging is the concept 
                        of seeing what you outputed and rethinking adn rewriting code in order to get the program to work
                        correctly.

                <h4 id="section2-1">Section 2.1: Introduction to Numbers in Programming</h4>
                <p>Computers and numbers are like peanut butter and jelly. They go together, but why?
                    What makes computers superior to humans is the ability to calculate and manage numbers
                    easily. Imagine processing <a class="italics">1024 * 546</a> in your head. By the time,
                    you probably even register the thought in oyur head, a Python program could have easily
                    displayed the answer.
                </p>

                <p>Let's revisit our trusted <a class="italics">print statements</a> and try printing some numbers.
                You can try simply:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="integer">1</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h4 id="section2-2">Section 2.2 Simple Math with Python</h4>
                <p>Python offers many simple math operations to perform. It offers the standard
                    four operators in math:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition: +</li>
                    <li>Subtraction: -</li>
                    <li>Multiplication: *</li>
                    <li>Division: /</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Python also offers the modulo operator (%) , which is similiar to calcualting the remainder
                    of two numbers. For example 7 % 3 = 1. 
                </p>
                <p>Simply, if we want to print any simple math between two numbers, we can simply do:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="integer">2</span><span>+</span><span class="integer">2</span><span class="keyword">)</span>

                <h4 id="section2-3">Section 2.3 Advanced Math and Variables</h4>
                <p>Another mathematical concept that is in programming is variables, commonly taught in a high school algebra
                    course. However, variables in algebra are different than variables in programming. In programming, variables
                    act a container that can hold a value. It's best if we see an example.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">x</span> = <span class="integer">6</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In the code snippet above, you have created a container with the label "x" that is 
                    holding the value of 6. Variables can be called whatever you want (i.e num1, number, potato),
                    as long it is not a keyword in python (i.e for, in, break).
                </p>
                <p>If you want to print out whatever is inside the container using print statements, you
                    can simply write:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="variable">x</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Note, in this case you omit the quotation marks. If you are printing with quotation
                    marks, you'll print whatever is in between the quotation marks, which is known as a<a class="italics">
                    string.</a> Printing just x, will output:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="terminal">6</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>What if we needed to change the value within our container? In computer language, what if
                    we needed to change the variable value? That is a simple fix:
                </p>

                <p>As we start to read longer programs, it is essential to understand how programs run. 
                    Let's take Example 2.3.0 as a simple example. Programs read from the 1st line, then 2nd, and so
                    on so forth. 
                </p>
                <p>The start of the program occurs at line 1 (this might not always be the case, but most programs
                    for now will start at line 1). At the start of the program, we create a variable "x" and 
                    <a class="italics">assign</a> it the value of 6. Then we move on to line 2, and we ask the program
                    to print the value assigned to x. At line 2, or the state of the program at line 2, x is assigned 
                    the value 6, so it prints out 6. 
                </p>

                <p>At line 3, we assign a new value to x. We do not destroy and recreate the variable, but 
                    instead we reassign a new value to x. A variable <a class="italics">CANNOT</a> hold two values 
                    at once.

                  </pre>
                  <p>We have TWO boxes now. But what if we wanted to put the value in y into x? Essentially,
                     we want to put 8 into x. Granted we could do the same way we did in the previous example, 
                    but what if we did not know y equals 8? What if y was also changing throughout the program?
                  </p>
                  <p>To make x have the same value as y, we say:</p>

                <p>Now that we know how to handle multiple variables and operators, we can start

                <h5>Section 2.2</h5>
                <p>Python offer five operators for numbers</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition: +</li>
                    <li>Subtraction: -</li>
                    <li>Multiplication: *</li>
                    <li>Division: /</li>
                    <li>Modulo: %</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Section 2.3 & 2.4 & 2.5</h5>
                <p>Variables are containers to store values. They can have any name you give it 
                    , as long it is not a keyword in Python.
                </p>
                <p>Variables can change values over time in a program like so: </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">x</span> = <span class="integer">6</span>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(</span><span class="variable">x</span><span class="keyword">)</span>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">x</span> = <span class="integer">5</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>You can also have multiple variables running simultaneously such as:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">x</span> = <span class="integer">6</span>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">y</span> = <span class="integer">8</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>As long as your variables are numbers, your standard operators will work on variables 
                    too.
                </p>

                <h4>Section 9.1 Inheritance of Classes</h4>
                <p>Now that you have learned what primitive and non-primitive types are, you'll soon 
                    realize almost everything is non-primitive. As you create your own objects, you'll 
                    might find yourself running into this problem.
                </p>
                <p>Suppose we have a person class:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="variable">Person():</span>
<span class="line-number"></span>   <span class="keyword">def </span><span class="variable">__init__(self, name, age):</span>
<span class="line-number"></span>       <span class="variable">self.name</span> = <span class="variable">name</span>
<span class="line-number"></span>       <span class="variable">self.age</span> = <span class="variable">age</span>
<span class="line-number"></span>       <span class="comment">#could have other things like birthday, hair color etc.</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>And suppose you are creating a school database server (i.e a place to manage students and staff). Then
                    it would be helpful to make individual class for each type of person (i.e <code class="inline_code">student</code> 
                    , <code class="inline_code">teacher</code>, <code class="inline_code">principal</code>, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>Now, whether you are student, teacher, principal or whoever you are, you have the share aspects 
                    as a <code class="inline_code">Person</code>, that is you have a name, age, birthday. So, it would 
                    seem kind of annoying to have give each student, teacher, principal, a name and age each type you declare it.
                    After all, our goal in programming is to reuse as much code as possible.
                </p>
                <p>This is where the idea of <a class="italics">Inheritance</a> comes into play. Inheritance allows us to 
                write generic classes that other classes can inherit its variables from. So instead of writing:</p>

                <p>We can create a generic (parent) class that another class (child) can inherit from. Additionally, 
                    child classes can inherit methods as well. The next section will cover how to create parent and 
                    child classes.

                <p>Parent classes are not any different than the regular classes you have been writing in chapter 8. 
                    In the case of a generic <code class="inline_code">Person</code> class, you can simply write:
                </p>
                <pre>

                </pre>
                <p>Now let's say we want to create a <code class="inline_code">Student</code> class now that 
                inherits the variables and methods from <code class="inline_code">Person</code>. To make a class inherit from 
                another, you write:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="variable">Student(<span class="args">Person</span>):</span>

                </pre>
                <p>Now, to create an instance of a <code class="inline_code">Student</code>, we need an <code class="inline_code">__init__()</code>
                method. This is no different than a regular class (and you should treat these as regular classes). But what if we want to use the same constructor 
                as our parent class? To do so, we call the parent's constructor using the <code class="inline_code">super()</code> keyword like so:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>

                <h2>Chapter 11: Importing Files</h2>
                <h4 id="section11-1">Section 11.1 Introduction</h4>
                <p>An overarching goal of this document and programming in general is to reuse as much code 
                    as possible. Additionally, whenever you use libraries (i.e PIL and TKinter for GUIs), you 
                    are essentailly re-using someone else's code. Imagine if you had to re-type all the code 
                    in a library before using it.
                </p>
                <p>Importing is usually used for importing Python libraries. <a class="italics">Libraries</a> 
                are portions of code that someone else or you have written. Using libraries are useful as some libraries 
                often have cool functions and require you to access low-level parts of your operating system. We won't dive 
            into how these libraries work, but it is a good read if you are interested in low-level programming.</p>

            <h4 class="section11-2">Section 11.2 Files and Directories</h4>
            <p>Before we can import libraries and other files, we have to understand what is a file first. 
                <a class="italics">Files</a> are the individual programs on your computer. This could 
                be <a class="italics">scratchwork.py</a>, <a class="italics">word.txt</a>, 
                <a class="italics">homework.pdf</a>. <a class="italics">Directories</a> are the folders that can store
                multiple files. This could be your desktop, downloads, or homework folder you might have created.
            </p>
            <img src="images/workingwithfiles_address_bar.jpg">
            <p><a class="italics">Pictured above is a "Documents" directory. It contains files like Budget.csv, CoverLetter.txt 
                and it also contains other directories like Photos, Recipes, etc.
            </a></p>
            <h4 class="section11-3">Section 11.3 Importing Local Files</h4>
            <p>For now, we will only focus on local imports, that is importing a Python file that's in the same 
                directory as another. Let's say we have a method in one file that generates a random password based on someone's 
                email:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="comment">#call this program file1.py</span>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">def </span><span class="variable">print_info(email): </span>
<span class="line-number"></span>   <span class="variable">password </span>= <span class="string">""</span>
<span class="line-number"></span>   <span class="keyword">for </span><span class="variable">i </span><span class="keyword">in </span><span class="variable">email: </span>

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>And let's say you were developing a bank platform and wanted to reuse this password generation 
                method. In this case, everytime a new user is created, the bank.py creates a password the user

            </pre>
            <p>To import methods or classes from other files, you'll need two keywords: <code class="inline_code">from</code>
            and <code class="inline_code">import</code></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code class="inline_code">from</code>: dictates which file you want to import from</li>

            <h4 id="section11-4">Section 11.4 Importing Libraries</h4>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, libraries are pieces of code written by other people. Most of these 
                libraries do not exist on your computer intially, and you'll need to install the libraries on 
                your system before using 
                it. (Some libraries come pre-installed with the Python installation)
            </p>
            <p>To install a library, you'll need to usually use <code class="inline_code">pip install {insert whatever 
                library here}</code> in your terminal. To check if a library is sucessfully installed on your system, try
            and find the version of the library and print it to your terminal.</p>

            <p>For example, let's practice by installing <a class="italics">Tkinter</a>, a popular Python library 
            for building GUIs. To install Tkinter, go to your terminal and type in</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
<span class="terminal">pip install tk</span>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Once <a class="italics">Tkinter</a> is installed, you can import it, using the same keywords 
            as if it was a local file.</p> 
            <pre>
                <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="variable">tkinter</span><span class="keyword"> import</span> <span class="variable">*</span>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>It's important to note that every library has a different installation process and import process. You 
                should always consult the official library's website for proper installation.

                <h4 id="section12-1">Section 12.1: What Are Exceptions?</h4>
                <p>It is all too common to run into exceptions in coding. You may be familar with
                    some basic types of exceptions, such as IndexError and ZeroDivisionError. These are 
                    what cause our programs to crash unexpectedly. Let's view some common exceptions you 
                    have probably run into while debugging.
                </p>
                <h5>ZeroDivisionError</h5>
                <p>Consider this code:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="keyword">print(<span class="integer">1<span>/</span>0</span>)</span>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Maybe from math class you know this as undefined. In fact, Python does not know what to do 
                    when this occurs. Thus, it raises the ZeroDivisionError.
                </p>
                <h5>IndexError</h5>
                <p>Consider this code</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
<span class="line-number"></span><span class="variable">arr</span> = <span class="integer">[0,1,2,3]</span>
