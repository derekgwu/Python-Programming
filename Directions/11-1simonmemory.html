        <h2>Chapter 11.1 Excercise: Simon Memory Game</h2>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Translating Requirements.</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>In this assignment, you will recreate the simon color game. If you are unfamiliar with the game, I'd suggest 
            you read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)"> here. </a> You can also play it
            <a href="https://www.memozor.com/simon-games/simon-game">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The simon color game tests a user's memory. It generates a random order of colors (red, blue, yellow, green)
            and makes the player recite the exact order of the colors. If the player incorrectly inputs the right order, they lose.
            Otherwise, the player wins the round, and the subsequent round with have to remember the same sequeunce with an
            additional color.
        </p>
        <p>To help, I have already made an unfinished method that generates a random order of colors. However, you need to finish the 
            method by storing the sequence of colors and return it for your use. 
        </p>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Some editions of the game support a time limit on inputting colors. This is not neccessary for our version,
                but you are move than welcome to import the time library and implement one.
            </li>
