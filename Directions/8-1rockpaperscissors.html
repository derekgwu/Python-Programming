        <h2>Chapter 8.1 Exercise: Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>User Input and Output</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>Develop your own single player text-based rock paper scissors. While most rock paper scissors games 
            are played by two people, your Python edition of this game will support one real person while the other  
            person is simulated by a computer (using randomly generated values). 
        </p>
        <p>The game should follow this format: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The game starts by prompting the human to enter their name. You should create a 
                <code class="inline_code">Player()</code> class that can store a user's name, rounds won, 
                and what move they play in a round. 
            </li>
            <li>After the user creates a name, they will enter the game and be prompted to enter 
                rock, paper, scissor. If the user enters an invalid input, please re-prompt them to try again.
            </li>
            <li>
                The CPU player should randomly generate a move. This can be done by importing the 
                <code class="inline_code">random</code> library and use its methods. You can find it's methods 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Once both sides have made a move, the program compares the move and properly awards a winner. 
                The proper player's score is updated and the scoreboard is displayed after every round. 
            </li>
            <li>Rounds should continue to be played until the human decides to quit. Optionally, you can enable 
                a play again option or just use the terminal <code class="inline_code">cntl+c</code> to forcefully 
                quit a program.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hints</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I suggest the <code class="inline_code">randrange(start, stop)</code> method to randomly 
            generate numbers. Look at the module to understand the arguments.</li>
            <li>To constantly keep playing rounds, I suggest an infinite while loop. This is simply done by 
                <code class="inline_code">while True:</code>
            </li>
            <li>The exact wording is up to you and you can take creative liberties when designing this game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no source code for this project.</p>
