        <h2>Chapter 9.1 Exercise: Racing Cars</h2>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Methods</li>
            <li>Translating Requirements to Code</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>In this assignment, you will be creating your own racing simulator. In many racing games, such 
            as Mario Kart and Need For Speed, you are given the opportunity to choose your own car before racing 
            it. In the assignment, the cars will be represented as objects. You will design a program such that 
            a user can select a car and race the car, generating theorectical lap times. 
        </p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>The design can be broken down into two parts, the design of the cars and the interactive method.</p>
        <h5>Designing the Classes</h5>
        <p>You are responsible for designing three car classes, that will all inherit from a parent 
            <code class="inline_code">Car</code> class. The parent class consist of important characteristics
            that each sub class will need to also have:
            <ul>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Speed</code>: This is an integer value that represents how 
                fast a car is. It ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being very slow and 100 being very fast. A 
                car with a high speed value will benefit from a lower lap time.</li>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Weight</code>: This is an integer value that represents how 
                heavy a car is. It ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being light and 100 being heavy. A car with 
                a high weight value will move slower, while a lower weight value will move faster, hence having 
                a lower lap time.</li>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Control</code>: This is an integer value that represents how 
                much control a car has. Cars will not have a consistent lap time each time they complete a lap. 
                This means they will have laps where it will take them longer than usual to complete it.
                The integer ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning no control and 100 meaning high control. A car 
            with high control will have less variation in lap time, and it can result in a lower lap time. </li>
            <li><code class="inline_code">compute_time()</code>: This method simulates 50 laps and generates 
            times based on a car's speed, weight, and control. </li>
            <li><code class="inline_code">convert_time():</code>This method prints out each lap time to the terminal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <code class="inline_code">Car</code> class has been completed for you already, and due to the complexity 
            of the <code class="inline_code">compute_time()</code> and <code class="inline_code">convert_time():</code> methods,
        you'll likely want to use a form of inheritance to reuse code when constructing the other three subclasses. The three 
            subclasses you will have to create yourself are:
            <ul>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Bullet</code>: This car has extreme speed, but it's great 
                speed makes it diffucult it to control. It's weight is standard to most cars.</li>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Precision</code>: This car is a master at sharp turns and 
                staying on course. It requires multiple modifications to have this stability, which 
                weight it down signficantly.</li>
                <li><code class="inline_code">Feather</code>: This lightweight prototype takes off 
                many modifications to maintain a light framework. With less modifications, like engine 
                additions and afterburners, the speed aspect is low on this car.</li>
            </ul> </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="italics">Hint:</a> In the parent constructor of <code class="inline_code">Car</code>, it 
            takes 4 arguments. You probably want to hard set the speed, control, and weight for each car, so 
            your child <code class="inline_code">__init__()</code>, should only take one argument, and you 
            should manually pass the stats you want to the <code class="inline_code">super().</code>
        </p>
        <h5>Designing the Interactive Portion</h5>
        <p>This section you have more freedom. You should prompt the user twice, once to name their car and another 
            time to choose their car. If a user does not successfully input either one, re-prompt them. Once their 
            car has been set up, use the proper inherited methods to generate simulated times for them.
        </p>
        <p>There are no unit tests for this. You should be able to use all the cars, and the input/output should 
            function properly.
