        <h2>Chapter 6.1 Excercise: Hangman</h2>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Loops</li>
            <li>Translating Requirements</li>
            <li>Strings</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>In this assignment, you will recreate hangman. If you are unfamiliar with hangman, you can view the 
            rules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>This will be a singleplayer version of the game. To generate the words, we will use the 
            <code class="inline_code">random_words</code> library to generate our words. (Note: if
            you find a better library please let me know!)
        </p>

        <p>I have provided to 2 methods to help you out. 
            <ul>
                <li><code class="inline_code">generate_word():</code> Using the random word library,
                this generates a word for the user to guess</li>
                <li><code class="inline_code">generate_blank():</code>This converts the word to be guessed 
                into blank so you can print the length to the screen</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You should keep track of the letters guessed by the player and print out every letter they have guessed 
            after a guess. 
        </p>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Strings are immutable in Python, which means once they are created they cannot be changed.</li>
        </ul>
