## Introduction
In this project you will be making your own mini Nintendo Switch. While you shouldn't expect to play the latest Mario Game on your mini-switch, you will be able to create and login into the switch as users and play terminal games on your switch.

Like the other projects, this project is broken down into 3 milestones.

## Milestone 1 - Creating Users
In this first milestones, you'll use your knowledge of classes and create mini Nintendo Switch Users. These users must take on the name `User` for you to pass the test cases. Each user has the following properties:
- An email
- A password
- A username
- A preferred language
- A list of games

When a new `User` is created, they will pass on an email, password, and username. At the start, the preferred language will be set to English and the list of games will be empty. (Take this as a hint for making your constructor)

In order to change the preferred language, your class of `User`s will need a setter that takes a String and sets that string.

You should also have getters for all the variables in the `User` class. Be sure that your constructor, setters, and getters all match the naming schmeme in my unit tests.
